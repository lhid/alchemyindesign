          <h2>Research</h2>

          <h3>Requirements Gathering</h3>

          <p>
            I work directly with product owners and stakeholders to gather requirements and discuss any concerns. To better facilitate this, I created a Problem Definition worksheet by simply asking <i>Who</i>, <i>What</i>, <i>When</i>, <i>Where</i>, <i>Why</i>, and <i>How</i>. This helps focus the project on user needs and business goals, rather than pre-determined solutions.

          <h3>Analysis</h3>

          <p>
            I analyze the problem at hand to look for holes. Holes in our current design, holes in our data, and holes in the problem itself. I use competitive analysis to look at how our competition is addressing the same problem (if they're addressing it at all). I also use comparative analysis to look at how other applications outside of our vertical are addressing the problem. This allows us a broader perspective for arriving at a solution.
          </p>

          </figure>

          <h3>Experience Mapping</h3>

          <p>
            I use experience maps to give us the big picture of how our users and customers interact with our products and services. Because no interaction happens in a vacuum, it allows us to see how everything is connected in order to frame things in the appropriate context.
          </p>

          <h3>Personas</h3>

          <p>
            I create personas to generate empathy for the human on the receiving end of our solutions. They help us to understand what might be going on in that person’s life, their pain points, their motivations, and, most importantly, their needs. Without personas (or something standing in for the real end user), it is difficult achieve user centered design.

          </figure>

          <h3>Scenarios</h3>

          <p>
            Personas are a wonderful tool for creating empathy, but they are only half of the equation. Scenarios are important for creating the appropriate context of use for the interaction. The two of them together should act as a zoomed-in snap shot from the experience map.

          <h3>Information Architecture</h3>

          <p>
            I use site maps to get a better understanding of the current system, how it’s organized, and how the user has to navigate it. Where experience maps help us to see the big picture from the perspective of the user, the information architecture helps us to see the big picture from the perspective of the system itself. The next step is a comparison of the two to see where things are out of sync. Activities like card sorting and tree testing can help us get back in sync.
          </p>

          <h3>User Flows</h3>

          <p>
            I create user flows to show how a series of interactions are connected and how they relate back to the user’s task and goals. This is where the up front work of persona and scenario creation can be directly interpreted into interactions with the system. Just like with information architecture (and any of these artifacts, really), we can use them to review the current state as well as design new solutions.

          </figure>

          <h3>Wireframes</h3>

          <p>
            Because I follow Lean and Agile principles, I start at low fidelity and increase it only as necessary. We can talk about a list of tools that best enable UI and interaction design, but at the end of the day, pencil and paper are still the best. You can work quickly with minimal commitment, allowing you to iterate without become attached to any particular solution. But for the purposes of formal reviews and collaboration, I will translate iterations into digital wireframes for clarity.

          <h3>Visual Design</h3>

          <p>
            At the beginning of the visual design phase, I create a research board (usually on Pinterest) to support visual research that as it pertains to the project. If the visual identity still needs development, I create mood boards a la style tiles to explore various options for look and feel. If necessary, I create high fidelity comps to best depict how a new product or feature might incorporate the visual identity of the brand. Whenever possible, I defer to existing patterns libraries and style guides in order to maintain design consistency and expedite development.
          </p>

          <h3>Prototyping</h3>

          <p>
            I use prototyping as a proof of concept to demonstrate intended user flows and interactions. Prototypes prove invaluable, especially whenever hi-fi comps are omitted, and can be used not only as a reference during the development process, but for pre-development testing as well.

          <h3>Development</h3>

          <p>
            When appropriate, I am not afraid to jump into the code. Although my skills are primarily web based (HTML/CSS/JS), I am always curious about how things work under the hood. I mention this because I expect this curiosity to continue as I journey into native apps. I believe that knowing at least some code makes me a better designer.

          <h3>Testing</h3>

          <p>
            Testing is essential to user centered design. “Getting it right” doesn’t just mean winning executive approval, it also means launching a product or releasing updates that you have evidence that works. The only way to collect this evidence is through testing. Whether it is guerrilla-style hallway testing, remote testing, or in-person testing, I treat the design as a hypothesis and look for where it fails and I do it early and often.

          <h3>Analytics</h3>

          <p>
            I look at analytics to monitor the overall UX health and determine the success of a project based on the criteria established during the requirements gathering phase (and agreed to via the problem definition worksheet). Analytics shows us the quantifiable data we need to pair up with the qualitative data we uncovered during testing.

        <section class="section-minor">
          <h2>People</h2>

          <h3>Collaboration</h3>

          <p>
            Collaboration is what makes it all come together. As I have often said, UX is a team sport. I work openly by inviting others into the process and transparently by showing my work (including the ugly bits) every step of the way. I use project boards hung on any available wall to show what’s being worked on and give others a chance to respond early on.
          </p>

          <h3>Facilitation</h3>

          <p>
            I have ran workshops with stakeholders to gather data collectively and gain consensus within a department or organization. These workshops have included people from various positions in the org chart including executive leadership. Additionally, I have facilitated process for teams as an Agile Lead and helped others take ownership of their performance and workflow.
          </p>

          <h3>Leadership</h3>

          <p>
            I believe that having more experience and advanced technical skill isn’t enough to qualify someone for a senior role. The right candidate must demonstrate leadership skills. This doesn’t just mean taking lead, directing others, or making final decisions. It means putting the team first by helping others and sharing your knowledge and experience through coaching and mentoring.
