A Web Designer's Toolkit


If you work in web design today, then you're already aware of the list of things you should probably know and/or practice in order to be good at your job. You can probably ramble off a list of items that you would consider part of your toolkit, but have you ever stopped to right those things down? Well, I did. And that's what I've done here.

  Adobe Create Suite
    Photoshop
    Illustrator
    Fireworks
  Text Editor of Choice
  Git/SVN/Version Control
  Browser Testing/Differences (desktop/mobile)
  Operating Sytems Differences (Mac/Windows/Linux)
  HTLM5
  CSS3
  JavaScript
  Mobile First
  Responsive Web Design
  Progressive Enhancement
  Graceful Degradation
  Semantic Code
  User Experience Considerations
  User Interface Design
  Information Architecture
  Usability
  Accessibility
  General Design Priciples
    Typography
    Color Theory
    Form & Function
  Optionally...
    MV*
    Some back-end tech (PHP, Ruby, ColdFusion, etc.)
    Some database tech (MySQL)
    Modular/Object Oriented Design
    Agile

So, if you come home from work and are absolutely exhausted, you may better understand why. If you are just starting out, this is a list of terms that you probably should become familiar with.

If there are any that I missed (and I'm sure I missed a few), let me know in the comments below. Cheers!
