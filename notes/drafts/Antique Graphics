Antique Graphics

I know that many of us wait an entire lifetime to make it to the Antique Toy Museum in Branson, MO. Over the weekend, I had the pleasure to fulfill this dream. I know wait you're thinking... "That lucky devil!". But before you draw and quarter my effigy out of envy, I have returned with photo-documentation of my journey and it is a sheer feast in vintage graphic design.
