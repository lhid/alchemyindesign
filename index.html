    <div class="l-row">
      <div class="l-col l-col--6-12">
        <p>
          I use research, design, and evaluation to connect user needs with business goals within the constraints of technology.

        <h3 class="txt-tight-b">Research</h3>

        <p>
          I ask questions. Lots of them. I conduct internal interviews to understand your product, service, and organization. I also talk to your users and customers. The best way to find out what people need and how they’re interacting with your brand is to go straight to the source.

      </div>

      <div class="l-col l-col--4-12">
        <h3 class="txt-tight-b">Design</h3>

        <p>
          I create various artifacts with various tools for the ultimate deliverable of a better user experience. Some examples of artifacts created may be journey maps, userflows, site maps, wireframes, and prototypes. Some examples of tools used may be pencil & paper, Illustrator, Photoshop, InvisionApp, and HTML/CSS/JS.

      <div class="l-col l-col--4-12">
        <h3 class="txt-tight-b">Evaluation</h3>

        <p>
          I want to make sure what we create together actually solves a problem, so I test it! I like to test before in order to set a baseline. And I like to test after in order to evaluate the changes. And by embracing iteration, we can take this information and feed it back into Research, starting the cycle over again as many times necessary to adequately solve the problem.
