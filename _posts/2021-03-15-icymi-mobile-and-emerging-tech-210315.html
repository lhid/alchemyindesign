    I&#39;ve always been amazed at how slow the adoption of QR codes has been&nbsp;here in the US, especially compared to Southeast Asia. Predictably, the pandemic, or more specifically, <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/qr-codes-make-inroads-in-u-s-with-shift-to-contactless?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202021-03-09%20Retail%20Dive:%20Mobile%20Commerce%20%5Bissue:32890%5D&utm_term=Retail%20Dive:%20Mobile%20Commerce">the need for contactless shopping solutions, has led to an uptick</a>. Maybe this time around, we&#39;ll see a more creative use&nbsp;of code destinations&nbsp;(like AR) which I believe, in part, the lack thereof has been to blame for its sluggishness.

    DevOps is not the area of app production that I typically play in, but I&#39;m all for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/rent-the-runways-first-ios-team-launches-runway-an-easier-way-to-coordinate-app-releases/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">a tool that can help with the cat herding that is the app&nbsp;release cycle.</a>&nbsp;The price point is a bit rich for smaller teams and indie developers, but it&#39;s clearly built with larger teams and orgs in mind. We&#39;ll have to see if it delivers on the integrations and workflow efficiencies that it claims.

    Disney has long been lauded as a case study in exemplar UX and service design. I&#39;ve personally enjoyed there use of RFID-enabled MagicBands, but often wondered why they didn&#39;t make use of the&nbsp;<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/12/disney-magicmobile-enables-park-passes-more-on-iphone-apple-wallet-first">mobile app, mobile wallet, and smart watch&nbsp;experience instead</a>. Apparently they did too!

    If you&#39;re an Apple user like me and have felt guilty about your recent investment in Nest Audios and Nest Minis, you may be relieved to learn that Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/">discontinued their original HomePod</a>. If you own a HomePod (also like me), it may not be missed on you that, as an Apple product, it seemed to&hellip; ahem, lack attention. We&#39;ll see if the adorable little minis fare any better.

  <p>
    And I have no idea what a practical application of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-cameras-122009466.html?utm_source=sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_morning_after">30x &#39;microscope&#39; camera</a> might be, but I&#39;m here for it!
