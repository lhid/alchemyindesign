    <strong>Unpacked.</strong> First off, we have another Galaxy Unpacked tomorrow. Want to know what to expect? The short version is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-z-fold-3-z-flip-3-watch-active-4-buds-2-154226625.html">foldables</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/what-to-expect-from-samsungs-next-unpacked/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">watches</a>. I&#39;ll likely do a notes dump afterward to dive into the details there. In the meantime, we&#39;re left with speculation.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Safari.</strong> The redesign that people have been making a fuss over <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596478/apple-ios-15-beta-safari-tabs-compact-optional">is optional in the latest iPadOS beta</a>. That&#39;s cool, although I wish they&#39;d show a bit more of that Apple swagger and commit to the redesign. Change is hard, but we always adapt. For the iOS version, Josh Collie <a href="http://medium.com/@joshcollie/refreshing-ios-15-safari-b57c1087083d">took the time to put together some propsed improvements</a> while maintaining the overall redesign.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Pixel 6.</strong> Working with mobile apps, what we can and cannot do at the software level is intrinsically coupled to what&#39;s going on at the hardware level. With what we currently know from <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-tensor-debuts-new-pixel-6-fall/?utm_content=cta&utm_source=kw-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=08052021">the soft announcement of the Pixel 6</a>, the new Tensor chip &mdash; designed directly by Google &mdash; may be the most notable. It&#39;s all about the AIs and the MLs, people! For a slightly deeper dive, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">check out the tentative review</a> by Cherylnn Low.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>G Maps.</strong> As an example of doing platform-specific integrations, the next version of Google Maps on iOS will allow for location sharing via a mini app for iMessage. I&#39;ve always wanted to design an iMessage app, but finding the right use case can be challenging (i.e., &uuml;ber specific). Also in the update comes the ability to add a traffic widget to the home screen (which you could already do on Android). It&#39;s these tighter integrations that, when done correctly, give native apps an edge over their responsive counterparts.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Case Study.</strong> Closing out this week&#39;s issue, the Baymard Institute brings us <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/mobile-homepage-provide-full-scope?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Article%20Always%20Provide%20the%20Full%20Scope%20for%20Links%20on%20Mobile%20Homepages%2058%20Dont&utm_content=Article%20Always%20Provide%20the%20Full%20Scope%20for%20Links%20on%20Mobile%20Homepages%2058%20Dont+CID_e2d052fe5d82461fcaa161b919d3b659&utm_source=CampaignMonitor&utm_term=read%20the%20article">research-based best practices for mobile homepages</a>. More specifically, the recommendations cover scoping links for categories on e-commerce sites. Not quite as long a read as usual if you&#39;re familiar with their work, but it will still require a little more time to sit down and dig into.
