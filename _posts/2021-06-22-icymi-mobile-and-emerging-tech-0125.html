    <strong>Mark your calendar:</strong> Wednesday, July 21 is the date for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-live?sc_category=Owned&sc_channel=EM&sc_campaign=AL2021_EM&sc_segment=SB&sc_publisher=MKTG&sc_content=RegisterNow&sc_detail=06152021&sc_country=WW&mkt_tok=MzY1LUVGSS0wMjYAAAF9r1vmiwrSMVdb2v4zUIJWTJ7jseHUoEeiTC_LZe4VaUqHGBuV9daa9v80B4m5xyF5xH_BmMcJvfcvKw2L-JPvaMgnkCqUEhxqeVF8NaDDInsiVQ">this year&#39;s Alexa Live</a>. If you&#39;re like me and see voice as the next frontier of app design but have yet to sink your teeth into a project professional, this a good event to at least stay current in the meantime. I&#39;ve gotten a lot out of previous sessions (and I&#39;m still using my blue light glasses, coffee mug, and trucker cap that they sent out in a care package for last year&#39;s event!).
  </p>

  <p>
    And speaking of voice, it will now be easier to interact with your Android device using&hellip; er, your voice. <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-summer-2021/?utm_content=cta&utm_source=kw-newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=060172021B">Deeper integration with Assistant</a> is now available on more apps, allowing users to complete common tasks with simple commands, including Voice Access for passwords. As per usual, these and a handful of other updates <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-update-june-2021-starred-messages-earthquake-detection-alert-voice-access-password-160100755.html">will hit Pixel phones first</a> (which was a big reason I picked one up as a test device #HumbleBrag).
  </p>

  <p>
    The Baymard Institute has shared another study on <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/native-mobile-apps-launch?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Article%20New%20UX%20Research%20Study%20on%20Native%20Mobile%20Apps&utm_content=Article%20New%20UX%20Research%20Study%20on%20Native%20Mobile%20Apps+CID_dd4afc55a29ddc5d3db831cfd91c1d0d&utm_source=CampaignMonitor&utm_term=read%20the%20article">native mobile apps</a>. I&#39;ve referenced their work before and am a believer in their work. So much so that I&#39;m willing to share it out without, admittedly, having finished reading it yet (see also: still playing catch up). There are some interesting usage stats and usability recommendations that are worth taking a gander at.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should also take a gander at this article on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/apple-health/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">Health app updates for iOS 15</a>. Aside from the lovely collection of screenshots, there&#39;s a fairly in-depth conversation with Apple&#39;s VP of Tech on the origins of Health app. It&#39;s a reminder that many products start as a single idea and grow from there, even those owned by tech giants. It&#39;s also a good example of product evolution based on direct user feedback, not just expert advice.
  </p>

  <p>
    And not to keep going on about Apple, but I missed a few links from WWDC that I had meant to share last week (but forgot&hellip; oops). For the work that many of us do, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/whats-new/?id=06072021a">updates to the HIG</a> are always worth calling out, which were kindly listed out for us as a change doc. I also enjoy seeing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1567446924">what apps won the Apple Design Award</a> for inspiration and design trends (even if they&#39;re irrelevant to the industry I&#39;m in). I think that&#39;s it this time. Maybe.
