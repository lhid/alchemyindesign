  <h2>Week 46</h2>

    <strong>Push It.</strong> <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/push-it-3?utm_campaign=9340_2021-11-07&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Product+Hunt&utm_term=editorial">An app for sending custom push notifications to your friends</a>, was trending no. 1 in Top Free Apps in the App Store. It&#39;s currently limited to Australia and California, which, obviously by the complaints under <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push-it-get-it-now/id1588144619">Ratings &amp; Reviews</a>, wasn&#39;t clearly communicated in the description. But what I really wanted to point out is that some of the 5-star ratings do not match the content of the review itself.

    <strong>App Store&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/apple-says-app-store-wont-close-to-developers-over-holidays-as-in-previous-years/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">will stay open to developer submissions over the holidays</a>. As this is one of the busiest times of the year for app traffic, the change will be a boon for developers who need to push any critical fixes or updates. Of course the downside is that, if you&#39;re on a team that has to push out updates, you may not get the holiday break you intended.

    <strong>iOS 15.2 Beta.</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-2-beta-nearby-airtag-scan-legacy-contacts-112524218.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">AirTag searches and Legacy contacts introduced in latest beta</a>. In an effort to help deter stalking, Apple allows the ability to disable any nearby trackable items in the Find My app. You can now also designate someone as a Legacy Contact for accessing your digital info in the event of&hellip; ahem, your passing. We&#39;ll see how both of these features work once they hit public release.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Virtual Fitting Rooms.</strong> <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/s/your-guide-to-virtual-fitting-rooms?utm_campaign=etb&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=morning_brew">Everything that you need to know about the tech that allows shoppers to try stuff on at home</a>. It&#39;s a bit of a long read, but this post by Emerging Tech Brew covers a brief history, the underlying tech, and the current challenges. Although I doubt that you&#39;ll ever be able to replace trying things on in-store, it&#39;s still pretty cool to see how far things have come along since the initial days of online shopping.

  <p>
    <strong>App Icon Book.</strong> <a href="https://www.appiconbook.com">A book that celebrates the art and craft and the golden age of icon design</a>. In a thread on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/flarup/status/1458043469629431817">Michael Flarup announced</a> the Kickstarter campaign to power the first run of the now completed book. In what I&#39;m sure will become the new coffee table book for mobile product peeps, it&#39;s just a shame that it won&#39;t ship in time for the holidays.

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    Picking up where <a href="https://www.alchemyindesign.com/notes/2021/11/10/icymi-mobile-and-emerging-tech-452021.html">we left off</a>, I&#39;ll continue to dig in further on <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/12L">Android 12L</a>. Last week we thought about the why behind taking an app from phone to larger screens, this week we&#39;ll go over the how. At first pass, many of us &mdash; myself included &mdash; would likely want to start with layout concerns. After all, that&#39;s the most logical thing to address when changing screen sizes. However, some of the layout changes we might make could be affected by <a href="https://youtu.be/ir3LztqbeRI?t=528">the navigation and app architecture</a> and vice versa.
    </p>

  <p>
    The UI component itself is an easier lift, so it might be better to start here. If you are using the <a href="https://material.io/components/bottom-navigation">bottom navigation</a> pattern in the phone version of the app, Android recommends converting it to a <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/navigation-rail/overview">navigation rail</a> for larger screens. If you&#39;re not familiar, it was introduced earlier this year during <a href="https://io.google/2021/session/b2f0dee6-b649-4e20-8ad6-69266e353f05/?lng=en">Google I/O</a> and rolled out with the subsequent <a href="http://material.io/components/navigation-rail#behavior">Material Design</a> updates. This pattern makes better use of the available real estate by moving the navigation from the bottom of the screen to the lefthand side.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Android, there is the concept of the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-design-graph">Navigation Graph</a> (similar to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/creating-a-navigation-stack">Navigation Stack</a> in iOS, if you&#39;re more familiar with that). For those of us on the design side, it&#39;s essentially the development version of a screen flow. This may be a good time to review the overall architecture and compare it against research data to make sure the navigation is in sync with the user&#39;s task flow. Additional changes that we may need to make to the views themselves could also affect the Navigation Graph, which we&#39;ll cover in next week&#39;s dispatch.

    <strong>P.S.</strong> App Annie has released a new report on <a href="http://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/6-mobile-forecasts-to-help-you-succeed-in-2022/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCappnewsletter">six mobile forecasts for 2022</a>. Probably worth the download.
