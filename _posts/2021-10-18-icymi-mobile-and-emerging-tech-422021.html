  <h2>Week 42</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>MacBook Monday.</strong> Starting with the nearest date, <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple a</a><a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/">nnounced a special &quot;Unleashed&quot; event</a>. In typical Apple fashion, not much is revealed on their website other than the date and time. But It&#39;s probably <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/apple-event-unleashed-october-18/">safe to assume</a> that it will be about the new MacBook Pro (as well as the new AirPods that were predicted for the September event). Technically, this isn&#39;t mobile news, but it is Apple. So, whatta ya gonna do?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Pixel Tuesday.</strong> As reported the previous week, <a href="http://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/">Google has also announced their </a><a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/">Pixel 6 Launch</a>. And, like Apple, their info about the event is sparse (other than the obvious, of course). <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/google-pixel-6-release-date-price-tensor-chip-specs-and-news">As more details</a> about possible tech specs find their way into the public view, we&#39;ll have to see what all holds true. Start that bingo card!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Galaxy Wednesday.</strong> Flying in just behind the Apple announcement, <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-galaxy-unpacked-part-2">Samsung has also also announced Galaxy Unpacked Part 2</a>. Just like Apple and Google, the invitation leaves a lot to the imagination. And again, <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-event-could-be-for-the-galaxy-s21-fe-12694961/">we can only speculate</a> that the Galaxy S21 FE (Fan Edition) will be the main topic of discussion, with One UI 4 (a la Android 12&#39;s Material You) coming in for an honorable mention. We&#39;ll just have to wait and see.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Material iOS.</strong> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/google-material-design-uikit-171651054.html">Google&#39;s iOS design chief announced they will phase out Material Design components in favor of Apple&#39;s UIKit.</a> This is a pretty big deal considering Google&#39;s size and resources, but it sounds like a strategically sound decision. And from what I know about custom components and iOS from having worked with mobile development teams, maintaining them is a pain as there is a potential for them to break with every iOS release.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Fuchsia OS.</strong> In other Google news, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22720403/google-fuchsia-operating-system-os-smart-displays-form-factors-partners">it appears that there are plans to continue expanding Fuchsia OS</a>. In case you&#39;re not familiar, <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">this is the system</a> that Nest Hub, Google&#39;s smart display, runs on. Admittedly, I thought they were&hellip; well, stupid until we bought one (looks like a tablet stuck to a speaker). But after spending over a year using one, I can say it&#39;s very functional, intended for use cases separate from those of tablets and speakers. So the above news has me enthused.
  </p>



  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    I&#39;ll continue my current obsession with Android fragmentation in the next issue (in favor of publishing ahead of today&#39;s Apple Event). I&#39;ll likely be diving into <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/oppo-launches-custom-android-12-skin-via-coloros-12/?ftag=CADc15b6ba&bhid=&mid=13545347&cid=2406480816">ColorOS 12</a> or following up on <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">Fuchsia OS</a> by which I&#39;m equally intrigued.
