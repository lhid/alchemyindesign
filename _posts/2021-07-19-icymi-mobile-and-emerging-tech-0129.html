    Images of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-unpacked-line-up-revealed-in-huge-new-leak-095533534.html">Samsung foldables, smartwatches, and earbuds</a> have been leaked ahead of the upcoming Unpacked in August. As I&#39;ve mentioned a few times before, I&#39;m most excited about the progression of foldables and, if forced to choose, I&#39;m not sure which I&#39;d go with &mdash; the folio or the clamshell style. Both have their benefits in terms of context of use and both make for interesting form factor problems to solve on the screen. Maybe I&#39;ll win the lottery between now and then and just buy both!

    <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/android-12-beta-3-arrives-with-scrollable-screenshots-better-on-device-search-and-more/">Google releases the third public beta of Android 12</a> as we near the full public launch. As per usual, priority will be given to Pixel devices, but I suspect that Galaxy devices will be next in line given the partnership that has been formed between Google and Samsung. What I&#39;m always interested in is the feature parity between platforms &mdash; like scrollable screenshots &mdash; and how it affects user expectations.

    AR/VR is a space that I have long been intrigued by, but I&#39;ve always been concerned about its adoption outside of novelty features. <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2021/07/12/poll-us-adults-mixed-arvr-workplace">According to this poll</a>, apparently the opinion of US adults is equally mixed. Maybe this will change as we start to see more practical applications &mdash; like scanning and wayfinding &mdash; nudge their way into our lives beyond gaming and novel ad campaigns. What I&#39;d really like to see is how favorability has changed over time.

    Okay, so I don&#39;t normally go on gushing about a product like this, especially not a Microsoft product. But having had the (dis)pleasure of using Windows machines earlier on in my career, I definitely agree that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575431/microsoft-windows-11-design-animations-start-menu">Windows 11 looks like it is full of delight</a>. As a designer myself, I can recognize the hard work and attention to detail that goes into creating an experience. Now, I just need to get my hands on a Surface Pro so I can test it out for myself!

Honestly, I always struggled a bit with the notion of modality as an abstract concept, but Raluca Budiu does a good job summing it up.
