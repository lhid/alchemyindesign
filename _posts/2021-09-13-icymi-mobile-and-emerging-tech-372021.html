  <h2>Week 37</h2>

  <img alt="Apple Event, 9.14" class="is-scalable" data-id="4345514" src="https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ef02f00f746e0f629442dbc6eec8e6a856b7c7a6/images/b037769f-e256-d602-264f-66fae7f993fd.jpg" />

  <p>
    <strong>Apple Event.</strong> The annual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/apples-next-event-is-september-14/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">September event</a>, often referred to as the &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-date-161123048.html">iPhone Event</a>,&quot; is tomorrow starting at 12pm CDT. We&#39;re expecting to hear announcements for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event-september-14-what-to-expect/">iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods</a>, to name a few. But I&#39;m sure there will be more. And many of us who already own these devices will be asking the same question: Is it worth the upgrade?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Microsoft Event.</strong> On the heels of the Apple Event, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/event">Microsoft is holding an event on September 22nd</a>. It is suspected that they will cover the new Surface as well as Windows 11. I missed the announcement for the Windows 11 event earlier this year and apparently I still missed <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/microsoft-surface-2021-event">this announcement by about a week</a>. But they definitely have my attention with their efforts to be more mobile-focused.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Android 12.</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-5-final-170051810.html">Google has released the final beta</a> ahead of the anticipated public debut. When the official release finally hits &mdash; starting with Google Pixels &mdash; the most notable change will be the UI refresh via Material You. And as a Pixel owner myself (test device), I&#39;m reminded that I could have downloaded the beta long ago and could be writing you today about my firsthand experience. Alas I have not, so I will be experiencing the public rollout with everyone else.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Material Redesigns.</strong> Along with several other apps getting a facelift a la Material You, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/10/googles-phone-app-is-next-in-line-for-a-material-you-redesign/">the Google Phone app is getting its day in the sun</a>. It&#39;s easy to neglect some of the more mundane system apps like Phone and <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/29/google-contacts-is-already-getting-its-material-you-ui-makeover/">Contacts</a>, so it&#39;s nice to see them getting <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/08/android-12-debuts-its-beautiful-new-material-you-clock-widgets/">the attention they deserve</a>. Be sure to check out the screenshots and additional links embedded in the article.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Social AR?</strong> Xsight, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/xsight?bc=1">an augmented reality app that I stumbled across on Product Hunt</a>, proposes the use of holographic overlays for people, places, and services. The places and services part I&#39;m good with. The people part? Not so much. It&#39;s a little too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosedive_(Black_Mirror)">Black Mirror</a> for my taste. Their promotional video is fun to watch and I want to be excited about it, but I&#39;m pretty sure a lot of the social features their suggesting run headlong into privacy concerns.
  </p>

  <p>
    And there was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Ot6Y0gBzs">this iPhone 14 leak</a> because, of course there was. 
  </p>

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    I&#39;m foregoing this section this week in order to expedite things some. I&#39;ll get back to it in the next issue.
