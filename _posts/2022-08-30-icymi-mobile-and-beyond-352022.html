  <h2>Week 35</h2>

    <strong>Apple Event&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">invite is officially out and the time is 12pm CDT</a>. For those who got the invite direct to their inbox, the headline simple reads &ldquo;Far out&rdquo; with the same galactic image that you see on the event website, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/24/iphone-14-event-invite-artwork/">hinting at</a> this year&rsquo;s theme. And in what has become tradition, there&rsquo;s an AR easter egg on the mobile version for you to explore. The official date &amp; time went live just hours (minutes?) after I published last week&rsquo;s issue. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-08-21/when-will-apple-announce-the-iphone-14-when-will-the-iphone-14-go-on-sale-l73dt7i1">Here&rsquo;s a peek</a> at what may be to come.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Fitbit Event.</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-smartwatch-launch-event-3199668/">In what caught many by surprise, Fitbit had a smartwatch launch event</a>. Announced just two days prior on Twitter, the Google-owned company <a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-versa-4-sense-2/">launched</a> the Versa 4 and the Sense 2 along with new leather bands. Fitbit is where I started my wearables (and fitness) journey, so it will always have a special place in my techie heart (and their mobile app is still aces). I couldn&rsquo;t find a replay of the event even on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/fitbit/videos">Fitbit&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a>, just a bunch of short product vids released around the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Android 13.</strong> <a href="https://blog.esper.io/android-13-deep-dive/">A deep dive into the changelog for Android 13 (and then some)</a>. If you haven&rsquo;t received the latest version of world&rsquo;s most popular mobile OS on your device or you haven&rsquo;t had time to really get down into the weeds with it, this is the post for you! In it, you&rsquo;ll find user-facing features accompanied by relevant screenshots, developer-facing APIs, as well as updates to Android Auto and Android TV. I couldn&rsquo;t have done a more thorough analysis myself!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Twitter.</strong> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/25/twitter-becoming-true-podcast-platform/">The company announced that podcasts are coming to Twitter</a>. As an expansion of the Spaces tab by way of a redesign, the company is hoping to capture some of the podcast traffic of its users. This comes as Twitter is still dealing with the ongoing Elon Musk drama, the staff <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-ceo-tells-staff-whistleblower-claims-are-inaccurate-internal-meeting-2022-08-24/">exodus</a> it accelerated, and security threat <a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/peiter-mudge-zatko-whistleblower-twitter#toggle-gdpr">allegations</a> by a whistleblower. It feels like the mobile-first platform is going through a bit of an identity crisis.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>BlackBerry.</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blackberry-movie-104051122.html">An upcoming movie revisits the rise and subsequent fall of BlackBerry</a>. Although the feature length film about the once iconic smartphone brand just wrapped production, details are thin on how much of the company&rsquo;s history will be covered. I still think about this <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/15481192446218959/">proposed prototype</a> and how different their future might have been had they course-corrected in response to the iPhone.
  </p>



  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    I wanted to try something a little different here this issue. With this being the season for launch events and product announcements, it feels like a good time to inject some device reviews. Whether you&rsquo;re a member of a product team looking for a test device, searching for your next every day carry, or just a curious enthusiast, checking in-depth reviews from trusted sources is always a good place to start.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the foldable side, Engadget has provided reviews for both the Samsung <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review-specs-price-a-flagship-foldable-refined-131543810.html">Galaxy Z Fold</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review-camera-samples-specs-price-battery-life-170027529.html">Galaxy Z Flip</a> (phones I&rsquo;ve been eyeballing hard myself). If Google is more your speed, here&rsquo;s a decent one from Phone Arena covering the <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/pixel-6a-long-term-1-month-use_id142087">Pixel 6a</a> after a month of use or, if you want to see how it stands up against other mid-range phones, you might check out this comparison against the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/pixel-6a-vs-samsung-galaxy-a53-vs-nothing-phone-under-500-phones-compared/">Galaxy A53 and Nothing Phone</a> from CNET. But if you&rsquo;re committed to Samsung and looking for a smartwatch, these reviews for the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-the-best-android-watch-for-now/">Galaxy Watch5</a> and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review-smartwatch-fitness-watch-a-good-mix/">Galaxy Watch5 Pro</a> (also CNET) could be helpful. And with the Apple Event around the corner, we&rsquo;re sure to see more hands-on reviews rolling out over the next few weeks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hopefully, you find these to be helpful. And if this something you already do, what other sources do you use before purchasing your next phone or wearable?
