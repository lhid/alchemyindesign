  <h2>Week 39</h2>

    <strong>Dynamic Fun.</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apollo-reddit-iphone-14-pro-dynamic-island-pixel-pals-update-221206984.html">Your iPhone 14 Pro&rsquo;s Dynamic Island can become the perfect home for your new pixel pet</a>. Reminiscent of the Tamagotchis from the early aughts, developers are clearly inspired by the new pill-shaped cutout. So much so that even some <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-phones-now-have-a-dynamic-island-known-as-dynamicspot/">Android devs</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-dynamic-island-android-realme-3211200/">OEMs</a> are getting in on the fun. I love this stuff!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>iPhone Bug.</strong> In less fun news, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/19/iphone-14-pro-max-camera-optical-image-stabilisation-motor?CMP=fb_a-technology_b-gdntech">the iPhone 14 Pro camera seems to have a jitter bug</a>. (I&rsquo;m so sorry). Reportedly only affecting social media apps like Instagram and TikTok, the camera physical &amp; visually vibrates when opened in-app. Thankfully, Apple already has an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/19/iphone-14-camera-shake-bug-fix/">update scheduled</a> that should fix it. But what I want is for them to fix the overheating I&rsquo;ve experienced while taking photos &amp; video outdoors.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Surface Event.</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-event-date-time-173943420.html">October 12th is the official date for this year&rsquo;s Surface Event</a>. It&rsquo;s expected that we will get our first official look at the new Surface Pro 9, Microsoft&rsquo;s 2-in-1 Windows tablet. It&rsquo;s also likely we will get some news on Windows 11, for which the first <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/20/microsoft-windows-11-2022-update-with-clipchamp-available.html">major update</a> of 2022 has set to roll out. And maybe &mdash; just maybe &mdash; <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/microsoft-windows-11">Android Apps on Windows</a> will come out of preview.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Pixel Watch.</strong> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/pixel-watch-were-starting-to-piece-together-what-googles-smartwatch-will-be-like/?ftag=CADc15b6ba">Ahead of the October event, here&rsquo;s what we know so far</a>. Launching alongside the Pixel 7 &mdash; the star of the show &mdash; this addition to Google&rsquo;s Pixel devices will take on the circular form factor of a traditional wristwatch. Powered by Google&rsquo;s own Wear OS, it will also integrate with Fitbit but will not be iPhone-compatible. Personally, much like with Android, I&rsquo;m just interested in seeing a pure Wear OS experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Fitbit.</strong> And speaking of which, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-accounts-ending-3212066/">Google will eventually replace Fitbit accounts with Google accounts</a>. Since becoming part of the company in January 2021, this doesn&rsquo;t come as much a surprise. The good news is that Google didn&rsquo;t pull a &ldquo;catch &amp; kill&rdquo; with Fitbit and is invested in integrating it more into its own ecosystem. Fingers crossed for a painless migration for all the avid Fitbit users out there.

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    Do you remember a pattern called &ldquo;Spotlight&rdquo; in Material Design? A fellow mobile designer and I went on a bit of a wild goose chase looking for this pattern that we both distinctly recalled being in the original documentation. Specifically, I remember it being an onboarding pattern that would have likely been found under the <a href="https://material.io/archive/guidelines/growth-communications/introduction.html">Growth &amp; Communications</a> section. I made several passes with keyword variations in a couple of search engines to no avail.
  </p>

  <p>
    It&rsquo;s one of those things where you could almost convince me that I had imagined the whole thing. And if it weren&rsquo;t for the shared recollection of the pattern name with my colleague, I&rsquo;d think exactly that. But I&rsquo;m convinced that Google just opted to remove it completely from their documentation, archives and all.
