    <strong>Mark your calendar</strong> (three weeks in a row, woohoo!): <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple announced its &quot;Spring Loaded&quot; event</a> for April 20 at 12:00pm CDT. In classic form, not many details have been revealed on what will be announced, so all we&#39;re left with is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2021/04/18/apple-predictions-april-20th-spring-loaded-event-imac-ipad-pro-imac/?sh=6c7b097ef6e8">speculation</a>. But with the news of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=gni836kR">a combined TV box</a> coming out just the day before, one can only wonder if the focus will be on a further attempt to revive Apple&#39;s smart-home product line. I&#39;ll say that, as an active user of both Apple and Google products, Google is currently winning this market.
  </p>

  <p>
    And while you&#39;re at it, <strong>mark your calendar</strong> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-pc-exynos-foldable-wearable-april-28-2021-230008640.html?utm_source=sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_morning_after">the next Samsung Unpacked event</a> on April 28th at 9:00am CDT. It&#39;s no coincidence that this is set for a week and a day after Apple&#39;s event, but I&#39;m okay with that &mdash; give me all the tech!!! And with most of us working from home still, hopefully our friends in PDT can make it a pajamas and coffee event.

    In other connected device news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/spotify-launches-an-in-car-entertainment-system-car-thing/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">Spotify launches Car Thing</a>, a screen device that essentially acts as a mobile juke box (kids, go ask your parents). As they also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/spotify-stays-quiet-about-launch-of-its-voice-command-hey-spotify-on-mobile/">rolled out voice commands</a> just a week prior, I would expect that deeper integration with &quot;Hey Spotify&quot; will be the biggest selling point (your phone currently has to be unlocked and app open in order for it to work and who does that?). As a user &amp; mobile designer, I&#39;ve been really impressed with Spotify&#39;s attention to the in-car experience on their mobile app alone, so I&#39;m excited to see what Car Thing has to offer (I signed up immediately&hellip; check the link at the end of the article).

    Filed under &quot;Posts I Wish I Had Written,&quot; we get a nifty step-by-step guide to <a href="https://material.io/blog/ten-steps-ios-android-design?linkId=116295411">bringing your iOS designs over to Android</a>. As someone who&#39;s had to do exactly that, I endorse their recommendations. Of course, I would expect you to trust a Material Design Advocate who actually works for Google&#39;s word over my own, but just for what it&#39;s worth.

    Following up on last week&#39;s announcement on LG&#39;s mobile division, I dove a little deeper into <a href="http://youtu.be/CAmZXCZ-e94">why they decided to close up shop</a>. Honestly, I had no idea that LG had been responsible for <a href="http://youtu.be/1HdibCYa9FI">so much innovation</a>. Now, admittedly, as someone who plays in the software layer, I haven&#39;t always cared about what happens in the hardware layer outside of what can be accessed through APIs to provide a better user experience. But if you work in this space long enough, I guess it&#39;s only a matter of time before you place equal importance on both.
