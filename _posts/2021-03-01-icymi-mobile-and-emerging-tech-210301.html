    As someone who is constantly studying mobile UI and interactions, I am always eager to see screenshots and videos of upcoming releases. With Android 12 officially in developer preview, we're getting to see some updates to the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/whats-new-in-the-first-android-12-developer-preview/">notification panel, settings, and one hand mode</a>. These features feel a bit iOS-y, but I think it shows a convergence of patterns between the two platforms like I've mentioned before.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're also seeing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/androids-latest-update-will-let-you-schedule-texts-secure-your-passwords-and-more/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">rollout of scheduled texts and improvements to TalkBack</a>, Android's screen reader, which I'd love to see find their way onto iOS. Frankly, the text-to-speech features like skimming a page or reading the headlines I'd use as sighted user. As we venture more into Voice, I'd also love to see these sorts of features be embraced beyond just accessibility items.

    For the musicheads out there, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/22/spotify-is-testing-a-redesigned-and-much-improved-library-ui/">Spotify may soon be getting an update to the Library view</a>. Reported on the Android version, we're seeing a move away from the tabs paradigm to a chip (or pill) pattern, similar to what you might find under Google Search results (like for an actor, movie, or TV show). Apple Music already does something similar for keyword search, which isn't exactly the same context of use (search vs browse), but it's interesting to see the evolution of patterns to accommodate complex IA.

    Through my shared love for nature documentaries with my youngest, David Attenborough has become a household name for us. So, naturally, when I learned that he helped create <a href="https://mobile-ar.reality.news/news/prehistoric-creatures-return-life-via-new-iphone-ar-app-from-celebrity-historian-david-attenborough-0384379/">an AR app for exploring the world of dinosaurs</a> (eek!), I stopped dead in my tracks (no pun intended… I think). Regardless of how cool you might find this app (David Attenborough + dinosaurs + AR = are you kidding me!?), you have to applaud taking educational content to the next level.

    And speaking of beneficial mobile features, how about your smart phone potentially saving you from a car accident? That's the case for <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-xl-saves-man-car-crash">one user who was rescued from an overturned vehicle</a> that had left him unconscious and with phone out of reach. After reading this story, I'm convinced that crash detection should be on all smart phones regardless of OEM.
