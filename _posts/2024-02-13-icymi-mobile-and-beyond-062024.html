  <p>
    It&rsquo;s the second day into the week and, admittedly, I&rsquo;m already tired. Or better put, I&rsquo;m still tired from staying up to watch the Super Bowl on Sunday night (kind of obligatory if you live in Kansas City). Last week&rsquo;s news started off slow, but then gained a full head of steam about halfway through. With no particular theme in mind for this issue, we steer back firmly into the land of mobile.

  <h2>Week 6 <small>(02/04–02/10)</small></h2>

    <strong>Apple&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24064617/apple-foldable-iphone-ipad-rumor-z-flip-5">could be working on a foldable iPhone (or iPad) &mdash; no, seriously</a>. Substantiated by apparent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-has-reportedly-made-foldable-iphone-prototypes-152804263.html">prototypes</a>, years of rumors may finally prove true. Reportedly, the engineer team is struggling with the challenges common to foldables (the hinge, screen crease, battery size) and we likely won&rsquo;t see a launch date until 2026. Despite Samsung, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-fold-2-3385460/">Google</a>, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review?utm_term=AE6695EC-5E6C-44C9-BF25-E7190F2ACED4&lrh=4a6d2b41ce63ab3c956deea0a77481533b8a7be1bfa2bc2a7ca237a1dac0c4fc&utm_campaign=6759021A-D895-43A9-94B3-C28A5FCE0BD6&utm_medium=email&utm_content=E3F0ABD1-2946-4FCD-99C4-F0EF777007BF&utm_source=SmartBrief">other OEMs</a> having multiple generations of foldables now, Apple is still the last holdout (sigh).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Google&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/bard-gemini-advanced-app/">released a dedicated Gemini AI app on Android</a>. Formerly known as <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-replacing-assistant-with-bard-3412760/">Bard</a>, the newly rebranded AI chatbot enhances the current Google Assistant experience, but with a catch &mdash; you have to choose one of the other. iOS users will, unfortunately, have to wait for the dedicated app, but can still access Gemini through the Google app.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Bluesky&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3OARuXw">is now open to the public after nearly a year of being invite-only</a>. This is good news to anyone who misses Twitter and is looking for an alternative, which includes a Twitter-like experience. For those who have never heard of Bluesky, here is a <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3HDTvi7">detailed explainer</a> as well as <a href="https://www.platformer.news/bluesky-public-opening-jay-graber/">the post</a> that was linked in the official announcement that hit my inbox.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Also, Apple&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=5mcfho5g">published a Q&amp;A piece by their own UX writing team</a>. Found in the February issue of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=8b8sp9s5">Hello Developer</a>, the team provided answers &mdash; with links to related guidelines &mdash; to common questions spanning topics like onboarding and notifications. I wanted to shine a light on this particular post because content strategy isn&rsquo;t covered very often&hellip; and also highlight the monthly newsletter as an additional resource (even if you&rsquo;re not a developer &mdash; I&rsquo;m not).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Also, Google&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr2-expected-features">is expected to include these features in the upcoming Pixel Feature Drop</a>. This is the most complete list to date (including screenshots &mdash; woohoo!) based on what&rsquo;s in the current Beta 3.1 release. The Pixel Feature Drop should roll out in March and, as the name would suggest, is exclusive to the Pixel lineup &mdash; the reason why I own a Pixel as my Android device.
  </p>

  <br />

  <p>
    <strong>And speaking of screenshots&hellip;</strong> here&rsquo;s a roundup of articles that include visual examples: <a href="https://9to5google.com/2024/02/07/google-maps-directions-search-redesign/">Google Maps</a> redesign, before and after; <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-4-design-changes-3411350/">Wear OS</a> design changes; <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/the-weather-channel-app-get-an-upgrade-heres-all-the-new-features/">Weather Channel</a> app overhaul; and Google&rsquo;s new <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-app-hands-on-3412632/">Gemini app</a>. You don&rsquo;t have to be a designer to appreciate slick UI and, as a designer myself (regardless of job title), I tend to bias towards the visual. So, I&rsquo;ll share more when I can.
