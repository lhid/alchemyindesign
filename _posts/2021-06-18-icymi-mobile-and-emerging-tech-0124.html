  <p>
    Like previous years, the WWDC21 Keynote was packed with software and OS-level announcements. In keeping with the scope of ICYMI, I&#39;ll be limiting this to what was announced specifically for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Format wise, I&#39;m writing this somewhere between my usual weekly dispatches and my post-event notes dump. I hope you find it useful&hellip;
