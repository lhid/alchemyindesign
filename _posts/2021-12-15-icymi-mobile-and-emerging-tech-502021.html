    <strong>Rollables?</strong> <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/tcl-fold-and-roll-concept-phone/?utm_campaign=160066_Editorial_Decrypted_12082021&utm_medium=email&utm_source=dotdigital&dm_i=6MG2,3FIA,1ZVVI1,G6L8,1">TCL displayed a foldable and rollable phone during the DTC 2021</a>. Although only a concept, it would bring new meaning to the term &quot;phablet&quot; &mdash; flexing from phone to tablet in a matter of seconds. It most likely won&#39;t find its way into consumers&#39; hands any time soon (if at all), but it&#39;s fun to consider the possibilities.

    <strong>Futurespective.</strong> <a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-will-smartphones-be-like-in-10-years-1848138666">A panel of experts were polled on what the smartphone might look like in 10 years</a>. Their replies are thoughtful and grounded in ongoing trends, some of which you might not have considered yourself (I hadn&#39;t). It will be interesting <a href="https://www.mobilephonemuseum.com/catalogue">to look back</a> 10 years from now to see how accurate some of the predictions were.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Smart Standards.</strong> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/matter-smart-home#toggle-gdpr">Speaking of the future, this interview covers the path forward for smart home standards</a>. Also available in podcast format, Tobin Richardson, CEO of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, discusses the current state of smart home devices (spoiler: it&#39;s messy) and what Matter, the proposed standard, hopes to achieve. All I want is for my devices to play nice together regardless of platform or OEM.

    <strong>Mobile Marketing.</strong> <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/5-campaigns-that-leveled-up-mobile-tech-in-2021/611148/">Here are five campaigns that integrated a variety of hot new tech this year</a>. As much as I&#39;ve tried, I guess there&#39;s no avoiding mention of the &quot;metaverse,&quot; especially when it comes to mobile tech. But I prefer to think of it more in terms of coolness that AR brings and, well, I can&#39;t help but appreciate creative marketing ideas (although there was at least one campaign that made me raise an eyebrow).

    <strong>12L Beta.</strong> <a href="http://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/12/beta-1-update-for-12l-feature-drop.html">The first public beta for Android 12L dropped last week</a>. Along with a refresher on the features that 12L will bring (layout optimization, split-screen mode, multitasking bar, etc), the post also includes a roundup of helpful links for both the design &amp; developer side. And if you can&#39;t get your hands on a 12L eligible device, there are setup instructions for the Android Emulator as well (although I&#39;d happily take a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-tab-series/lenovo-tab--p12--pro/len103l0008?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">Lenovo Tab P12 Pro</a> for Christmas!).

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    A buddy of mine at work lent me a Samsung Galaxy Fold3 that he managed to procure as a test device (I need some of his swagger to rub off on me!). I&#39;ve had it for a little over a week now and, I must say, it lives up to the hype. I still need a solid day (or 30) to really get an idea of daily use, but here are my thoughts so far.
  </p>

  <p>
    It&#39;s about as heavy as I would imagine, maybe even slightly heavier, but it feels solid like quality hardware should. The outer display is a lot narrower than I expected, but it&#39;s also slightly taller than both my Pixel 4a and my iPhone 12 Pro. I&#39;ve carried it around in my pocket for a few days and it doesn&#39;t really feel that much different (but then again, I typically carry around both phones because I&#39;m a nerd like that).
  </p>

  <p>
    On the software side, it feels very slick. It moves the current app seamlessly from the outer display to the inner (unfolded) display. Using split-screen didn&#39;t seem create any lags, with scrolling in Twitter and Google News remaining buttery smooth. It&#39;s still new enough as a form factor that, as you might&#39;ve guessed, not all apps are optimized for the larger screen size. What did surprise me was that not all apps supported split-screen view either (basically just two phone widths side-by-side).
  </p>

  <p>
    That being said, if I were an active Android user, the Fold3 would be my next phone. Hands down. In fact, I may have already looked into using my Pixel as a trade-in (but for whatever reason, the 4a wasn&#39;t on the list boooo!!!). It will be interesting to see what additional improvements come with the full public release of Android 12 L.

      <strong>P.S.</strong> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/oppo-smartphone-find-n-foldable-112030065.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">Samsung&#39;s not the only one in the foldable game</a> (just too bad Oppo doesn&#39;t have any retail partners in the US).
