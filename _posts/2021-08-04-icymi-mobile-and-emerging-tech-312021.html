  <p>
    <strong>QR Codes.</strong> When was the last time you heard anyone talk about QR codes? Well contrary to what you might think, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/technology/qr-codes-tracking.html?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Recode%207.27.21&utm_term=Recode">they&#39;re not going anywhere anytime soon</a>. And as you might suspect, yes, the pandemic has everything to do with it. See: Contactless transactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>App Redesigns.</strong> We already talked about a couple of redesigns last week, so add <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/google-tv-mobile-app-redesign-adds-new-services-and-recommendations/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">the Google TV app</a> to the list. I honestly don&#39;t recall what the previous design was like (not an active user), but the redesign feels very&hellip; familiar. Probably the most notable, though, is the stuff you don&#39;t see &mdash; Google&#39;s use of their expansive data set across their various properties. Which is both clever and scary at the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Maps.</strong> Would you like a social layer added to your map experience? <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2021/07/28/snap-brings-personalization-new-feature-set-snap-maps?email=leban.hyde@coxautoinc.com">Snapchat has it for you.</a> Yet another app that I do not actively use (I don&#39;t think I&#39;m their intended demographic re: age), this is the sort of thing that makes me curious as a designer. Adding data layers to a map &mdash; an already data-intensive bit of data viz &mdash; is a problem I&#39;ve had to solve before (and you may have as well), so I like to keep references like this in my back pocket in case it ever comes up again.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Super Apps.</strong> As you may have noticed in the article above, &quot;super app&quot; is a term I think we&#39;ll begin to see more of as mobile continues to mature and products begin to incorporate more and more features. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/paypals-new-super-app-is-ready-to-launch-will-also-include-messaging/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">The latest example being PayPal</a>, which is transitioning from its original intent as a payment app to a more complete digital wallet app. As this breaks the generally accepted principle of mobile apps having a singular focus, my question is: How well will users receive the change?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Mobile Wallets.</strong> On the topic of mobile wallets, <a href="https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/mobile-wallet-use-projected-to-surge/603910/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Newsletter%20Weekly%20Roundup:%20Payments%20Dive:%20Daily%20Dive%2007-31-2021&utm_term=Payments%20Dive%20Weekender">usage is expected to grow 50%</a> over the next five years in North America alone! This is another trend that we can attribute to the pandemic, but we can expect to continue well after COVID-19 is a thing of the past. One of the key points I find the most interesting, however, is the democratization of &quot;mobile money&quot; (and technology in general) as smartphones continue to penetrate emerging markets.
