    This app that can <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90652594/got-a-pile-of-random-lego-this-amazing-app-tells-you-what-you-can-build">scan a pile of Lego bricks and return suggestions of what to build</a> hits both the mobile and Lego sweet spots for me. Sprinkle in a little augmented reality and machine learning, and we may have the App of the Week (if that were I thing I did in this weekly post). I&#39;ve yet to play around with it myself, but I&#39;m not surprised &mdash; nor discouraged &mdash; by some of the challenges that Mark Wilson writes about in his review.

  <p>
    With a 14% increase in time spent and a 25% increase in global consumer spending in App Store and Google Play, it&#39;s probably not surprising that with it we&#39;ve seen an <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/6-campaigns-that-stood-out-amid-h1-growth-in-mobile-usage-app-spending/602924/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202021-07-08%20Mobile%20Weekly%20%5Bissue:35312%5D&utm_term=Marketing%20Dive:%20Mobile">increase in creative marketing efforts</a>. There were some pretty out there campaigns, but out of the six that were listed, the Barilla + Spotify pasta timer campaign is probably my favorite. I just wish I would&#39;ve known about it during lockdown.

  <p>
    Fresh from iOS 15 beta, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ios-15-closer-look-at-safari/">this review of the updates to Safari</a> is a solid walk-thru of some of the stand-out features from an interaction design perspective. I&#39;m particularly interested in the new Tab Bar and the improved interaction patterns it could bring (we&#39;ve already seen App Store play a bit with this pattern in App of the Day). For slightly deeper dive on the Tab Bar, <a href="https://twitter.com/pbannist/status/1413503812611067904?s=20">check out this thread on Twitter</a> by Paul Bannister.

  <p>
    On the hardware side of things, for those of us who would already have our hands on a foldable if it weren&#39;t for the price, we may now get our chance. Samsung may reportedly launch <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-lite-unpacked-2021-august/">a more affordable version of the Galaxy Z Flip</a> this August in an upcoming event. I&#39;m not sure what excuse you might use if you plan to plead your case with the expense department for a new test device, but I&#39;m reminded of that commercial from a few years back where people were &quot;accidentally&quot; destroying the phones for a reason to upgrade. Not that I would ever suggest such a thing&hellip;
  </p>

  <p>
    And it is slightly outside the intended scope, but file <a href="https://link.techcrunch.com/public/24421877">the new issue of The Station</a>, a mobility newsletter by TechCrunch, under the &quot;emerging tech&quot; portion of this dispatch. I would at least give the section on T.E.D.D.Y., the autonomous shuttle for Yellowstone, a read.
