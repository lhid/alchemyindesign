    <strong>Unpacked Recapped.</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/10/23299070/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-august-2022-announcements-z-flip-fold-4-watch-5-pro-buds-2">Here are the biggest moments from last week&rsquo;s Galaxy Unpacked</a>. To no one&rsquo;s surprise, the next Z Fold and Z Flip were announced, as well as Watch5, Watch5 Pro, and Buds2 Pro. Now four gens in, you may be asking if Samsung&rsquo;s foldables are ready and this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/z-fold-3-long-term-durability-report-heres-what-samsung-still-cant-get-right-130053466.html">year-long study</a> of the Fold3 attempts to answer exactly that. You could also check out this hands-on review of the <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review_id5482">Fold4</a>, <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-4-review_id5481">Flip4</a>, or watch <a href="https://youtu.be/FN3BtquTooA">the replay</a> of the event.

  <p>
    <strong>Xiaomi Foldable.</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mix-fold-2-leica-pricing-availability-124434422.html">The Mix Fold 2 also launched, Xiaomi&rsquo;s second gen foldable</a>. On the heels of Galaxy Unpacked, the Chinese brand&rsquo;s Fold4 competitor was announced packing a Leica camera and boasting a slimmer profile. Although it&rsquo;s currently only rolling out in China, I included it because it&rsquo;s an impressive phone and it&rsquo;s proof of foldable viability in other markets (the US may only be a matter of time).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Moto Foldable.</strong> <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3AfpDVW">The 2022 Razr <em>also</em> also launched, Motorola&rsquo;s third attempt at a classic</a>. Following Samsung and Xiaomi&rsquo;s announcements, Motorola piped up to join the fun &mdash; happy unofficial foldables week, indeed! Buuuuut following Xiaomi&rsquo;s lead, they&rsquo;re also keeping the release China-only. Grrrrr&hellip; Again, it&rsquo;s about market viability and the Razr getting upgraded with flagship specs bodes well!

    <strong>Foldable Stats.</strong> <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/foldable-smartphone-shipments-2022/">Shipments for foldables will grow 73% YoY to 16M units in 2022</a>. As you might expect, Samsung leads the market with a 62% share in the first half the year &mdash; which may likely increase to 80% in the second half. Note that these are global stats, but in the US market, Motorola may be the only contender against Samsung. Which is also the reason why I believe the 2022 Razr will eventually arrive State side.

    <strong>Foldable Biz.</strong> <a href="https://insights.samsung.com/2022/08/11/why-hybrid-businesses-need-foldable-phones/">Samsung lists 5 reasons why foldables are the right fit for hybrid business</a>. Yes, this is a marketing piece to promote the two Galaxy Z foldables. But you can rely on a company&rsquo;s need to maintain sales numbers by arguing a compelling case to its business customers. Out of the reasons listed (and as a SMB owner myself), true mobile productivity and device consolidation are, for me, the most convincing.

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    Continuing with the foldable theme, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about the software side of things, as mobile designers do. Watching the <a href="https://youtu.be/sxpJ8lczWcY">promotional materials</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-specs-price-availability-3194404/">hands-on reviews</a>, I noticed how much emphasis is being placed on multitasking and making optimal use of the new form factor. I also couldn&rsquo;t shake the fact that we&rsquo;re just taking a larger rectangle and dividing it into smaller rectangles in order to accommodate more information on the screen. And so I ask, is this the direction we want to go?
  </p>

  <p>
    What I mean is, there are more shapes out there besides the rectangle. Look at the wonderful work that Google has done with <a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you">Material You</a> and all the expressive shapes they use for <a href="https://m3.material.io/components/widgets">widgets</a>. They have become a major part of the personality of Android 12 and make my Pixel a delight to use. But are there opportunities to do the same within the multi-window space of a foldable? What apps could benefit most from a break with convention?
  </p>

  <p>
    I get it, when it comes to maximizing space, a rectangular app window best fills up a rectangular viewport. But does it have to be?
