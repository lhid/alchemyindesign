  <h2>Week 43</h2>

  <img alt="Pixel 6 & Pixel 6 Pro line-up" class="is-scalable" data-id="4399570" src="https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ef02f00f746e0f629442dbc6eec8e6a856b7c7a6/images/e43c8b40-2371-4368-4e7b-45723b047698.jpg" />

  <p>
    <strong>Unleashed Recap.</strong> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-unleashed-event-this-morning/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">HomePod mini colors, AirPods 3, MacBook Pro, and the M1 chips</a> pretty much sum it up. Okay, so not a whole lot of mobile in this one. None, actually. But we did get a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-the-apple-music-voice-plan/">Voice (-only) Plan</a> for Apple Music, which, from a user journey &amp; product ecosystem perspective, is an interesting move (especially since I don&#39;t personally have the best of luck calling up songs through Siri re: bilingual).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Pixel Recap.</strong> And <a href="http://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-event-2021-highlights-192245034.html">Pixel 6 Pro camera, the Tensor chip, Translate, and Real Tone</a> pretty much sum up the Pixel 6 Launch. The major theme of the event was the power of AI (which makes a lot of sense seeings how Google has all the data). And how on-device processing is made possible by the Google-made Tensor chip, showcased best by the &quot;live&quot; Translate demo with Marie Kondo (yes, <em>that</em> Marie Kondo). 
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Unpacked Recap.</strong> If I had to distill <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2-everything-you-need-to-know/">Samsung Unpacked Part 2 down to one word, it would be personalization</a>. Bespoke design, designer editions, One UI 4 (re: Material You), and the Samsung ecosystem were the main focus of the event. And as someone who lives life on the software side, I&#39;m really interested in taking a deep dive into One UI 4 in particular (maybe I&#39;ll set my Tab A up <a href="http://developer.samsung.com/one-ui-beta">on the beta</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Android Summit.</strong> <a href="https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit">The way I&#39;m approaching the Android Summit</a> is the same way I approach Apple&#39;s annual WWDC. The primary audience are developers, but there is plenty for UX and Product folx to learn as well. At the very least, it&#39;s worth taking a gander at the agenda and attending the keynote. This starts <strong>tomorrow</strong>, by the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Apple Talks.</strong> And speaking of Apple developers, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-tech-talks-2021-live-online-sessions-for-developers/">new virtual Tech Talk sessions were announced last week</a>. As I mentioned above, I would look past developers being the primary audience and attend some of the sessions anyway. I&#39;ve learned a ton in my career as a designer from attending sessions like these because it helps me to better understand the technologies that we work with. Consider it another tool in the box for making product recommendations.

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    If you&#39;re on (or have) a Google Pixel, you may have noticed that the public version of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/android-12-launched/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">Android 12 also rolled out last week</a>. I just installed it last Thursday evening myself, but have been just busy enough to not have had much of a chance to play with it yet. As I&#39;m out on PTO for the next few days, I&#39;m hoping to spend a little more quality time with it and get to know the updates a little better.
  </p>

  <p>
    Going off of what I&#39;ve experienced so far, I&#39;m seeing Notifications with much more rounded corners and a revamped Quick Settings with larger controls. The typographical hierarchy, most notable in the Settings app, has also been punched up quite a bit. And then, of course, there&#39;s the much anticipated Material You. As I have the stock &quot;4a&quot; wallpaper installed on my home screen, I&#39;m not seeing a huge difference with the variable color palette. But then again, I&#39;m boring like that.
  </p>

  <p>
    I&#39;ll continue updating as I get more acquainted with Android 12.
