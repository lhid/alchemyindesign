    <h4>Author's Note:</h4>

    <p>
      This issue was supposed to go out last week, but I couldn&rsquo;t pull the content together enough to hit publish. Delays on top of delays. Plus, there has been a lot more pressing stuff happening in the news that has provided an unwelcome distraction (putting it lightly). I didn&rsquo;t want this one to languish in my drafts folder, so here you go &mdash; better late than never!

    <strong>WWDC Recap.</strong> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wwdc-2022-everything-apple-announced/?bxid=62164441b70be94dbf14b53f&cndid=68749309&esrc=WIRED_CRMSeries&mbid=CRMWIR092120&source=EDT_WIR_NEWSLETTER_0_DAILY_ZZ&utm_brand=wired&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_content=WIR_PaywallSubs_060622_Special_WWDC&utm_mailing=WIR_PaywallSubs_060622_Special_WWDC&utm_medium=email&utm_source=nl&utm_term=P1">This minor event that you might&rsquo;ve heard of happened and some things were announced</a>. Among them, features for the upcoming <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-16-preview/">iOS 16</a> including a Lock Screen redesign, improved Focus Mode support, and Message updates. With <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-16-preview/">iPadOS 16</a>, we&rsquo;ll see the addition of Stage Manager for multitasking, a properly supported Weather app, and a revamped Home app with Matter compatibility. And <a href="https://www.apple.com/watchos/watchos-preview/">Watch OS 9</a> will bring better interval support in workouts, new medication reminders, and sleep tracking &mdash; all of which I&rsquo;m looking forward to. Keynote <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/101/">replay</a>.

    <strong>Amazon&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexalive?sc_category=Owned&sc_channel=EM&sc_campaign=AlexaLive_2022&sc_publisher=MH&sc_content=Invitation&sc_detail=Annual_developer_conference&sc_funnel=Convert&sc_country=WW&sc_segment=DF&sc_keywords=Register_Now&sc_place=DF&sc_trackingcode=&mkt_tok=MzY1LUVGSS0wMjYAAAGExOf9NrN6MVwD6SR_6zAFV2fszsFwQARRvjqzowyNLSqlJ9SOYzIb1pCtA6yJxCsAXHxWn7Pc1IFhfi_NdVJjyKLVI0M-vHq_0hbCIMuuIVMKVw">announced dates and registration for Alexa Live 2022</a>. In case you&rsquo;re not already familiar, it&rsquo;s Amazon&rsquo;s annual developer conference about voice, smart home, and related technologies. The half-day virtual event is split into three tracks &mdash; developers, brands, and device makers &mdash; and covers a variety of topics from skills development to device integrations. I&rsquo;ve attended the last couple of years and have always gotten something out of it, even if it&rsquo;s just to hear from another OEM besides Apple, Google, or Samsung.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Samsung&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-launches-mobile-wallet-app-to-compete-with-apple-and-google/">launched a mobile wallet app for storing credit cards, digital IDs, and others</a>. In an effort to compete with Apple and Google, the company is combining Samsung Pay and Samsung Pass into a unified experience. As companies continue their attempts at replacing physical wallets, it will be interesting to see how adoption and acceptance pans out. And with the current <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-unsold-phones-3178597/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dailyauthority&utm_term=Daily%20Authority">low demand</a>, it may give Samsung the sales boost they need.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Nothing&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-phone-1-release-date-rumors-specs-price-features-3170131/">Phone 1 confirmed a launch date plus what features we can expect</a>. Marques Brownlee published a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nothing-phone-1-hands-on-3178642/">hands-on video</a> showing off some of the details, including  a notification LED &ldquo;glyph&rdquo; on the back of the handset. But before you get excited, the first iteration is not slotted for <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nothing-confirms-phone-1-will-not-be-coming-to-us">arrival in the US</a> (network issues with local carriers). Nonetheless, I appreciate the whimsy of its differentiating features.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Foldables.</strong> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/it-might-finally-be-time-for-foldable-phones/?ftag=CADc15b6ba">Samsung, Motorola, and Google are rumored to have new foldable models in the works</a>. More of a roundup of the latest leaks and rumors than breaking news, it&rsquo;s still a solid review of the current state of foldables. And, even though many (all?) of these have already been mentioned in previous issues, the author does a good job adding addition context with shipment stats and market trends. It&rsquo;s worth the once-over if nothing else but to connect the dots of the foldable landscape.

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    Since I recently got back from travel, I thought <a href="https://builtformars.com/case-studies/delta?utm_source=Built+for+Mars&utm_campaign=7d50a5b586-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_05_27_07_20_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_63bd67cd8b-7d50a5b586-413711237">this case study</a> for the Delta mobile website was humorous (and, yes, I flew Delta). Complete with a slide deck of screenshots (plus annotations), it&rsquo;s a fairly quick read that highlights some of the major challenges with designing mobile experiences. In it, the author reminds us that links are often opened via in-app browsers on mobile, warns of the dangers of bugs in the core experience, and stresses the importance of showing (or hiding) the appropriate content from desktop to mobile.
  </p>


  <p>
    There&rsquo;s additional commentary I&rsquo;d probably add around the differences between native mobile and responsive web. For example, the infinite loading and keyboard collapse bugs that presents themselves in the mobile browser during a search task isn&rsquo;t something that native app users are exposed to (I had to go test it myself). Conversely, some of the issues that are described &mdash; like the the Comfort+ banner ad &mdash; do carry over from web to native which is a stronger indicator of internal team struggles (as the author already suggested). I wish I had the time to put together case studies &mdash; or just professional observations &mdash; like this as well.
