    <strong>Pixel Recap.</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-7-pixel-7-pro-pixel-watch-event-wrap-up-170055623.html">Here is everything that was announced at the Google Pixel event</a>. The Pixel 7 &amp; Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel Watch, and Pixel Tablet &mdash; all of which were previewed earlier this year at <a href="https://io.google/2022/">Google I/O</a> &mdash; were officially announced. In addition, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-home-app-smart-home-nest-cameras-130044455.html">Home app</a> is being revamped and guidelines for building <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2022/10/the-new-google-pixel-watch-is-here.html">Wear OS apps</a> were published as Google embraces a <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-ecosystem-blueprint-google-3214063/">product ecosystem</a> focus. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/2NGjNQVbydc">watch the replay</a> of the almost 1.5hr event here.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Google Widgets.</strong> <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3fJVfLm">In more Google news, Widgets for the iOS 16 Lock Screen also began rolling out</a>. Gmail, Google News, Drive, and Chrome are the first to arrive. However, Maps and Search are still in the works with no official word on a release date. It seems like there&rsquo;s an opportunity to bring Material You style widgets to your iPhone, although I won&rsquo;t hold my breath. I just hope Microsoft follows suit so I can see Outlook on my Lock Screen when Work Focus is on (mirroring my Apple Watch).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Apple Watch Ultra.</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-10-02/apple-watch-ultra-review-better-battery-life-and-screen-are-standout-features-l8reavuy">Bloomberg&rsquo;s Mark Gurman reviewed Apple&rsquo;s new extreme-sports Watch</a>. In it, he covers the upgraded battery, display quality, and rugged design, features that would appeal to regular folks &mdash; not just hardcore athletes. He goes into particular detail on the Action Button, including recommendations on how Apple might expand on its functionality. Given that I will likely never own one myself, it&rsquo;s fun to daydream about a scenario where one magically appears on my wrist.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Matter 1.0.</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23386883/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-google-launch">The interoperability standard from the Connectivity Standards Alliance finally arrives</a>. In collaboration with Apple, Google, Amazon, and others, the new standard that seeks to unify smart home devices is now open for certification. Want I&rsquo;m interested in is backwards compatibility for devices already in use because, let&rsquo;s face it, who wants to replace all their smart home devices with Matter certified ones? Read the <a href="https://csa-iot.org/newsroom/matter-arrives/">press release here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Foldables.</strong> <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/devices-home-banner/foldable-shipments-to-reach-41-5-million-in-2026/">IDC forecast worldwide shipments to hit 41.5M in 2026</a>. That&rsquo;s triple the number predicted for 2022 &mdash; 13.5M units. Unsurprisingly, price is a pain point for would-be customers, which could be offset by 2-in-1 use cases for the business user. But if you&rsquo;re considering support for foldables in your product, we&rsquo;re still a ways off from them being mainstream (doublecheck with your analytics, of course).

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    Picking up where I left off above on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-fall-event-2022/">Pixel Event</a>, I wanted to dwell a bit more on the <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3T63vnD">Pixel Tablet</a>. This is something I&rsquo;ve wanted Google to pursue for awhile now. I never understood why the original <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelslate/answer/9131383?hl=en&ref_topic=9116377">Pixel Slate</a> ran <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelslate/answer/9131920?hl=en&ref_topic=9116377">Chrome OS</a> when the seemingly obvious thing to do &mdash; especially when competing against the iPad &mdash; was to run Android. Just like they used the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/miss-google-nexus-series-poll-results-3216431/">Nexus</a> line, the Pixel&rsquo;s predecessor, to show other OEMs how Android was intended on the phone, they should&rsquo;ve been doing the same for tablet well before Android 12L. But we&rsquo;re here now, at least.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aside from flaunting prime examples of 12L screen design, what caught my attention the most was the emphasis on tablets being more of a home device. The use case that they painted made for a strong argument for pairing the Pixel Tablet with a <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3fPxn9u">charging speaker</a> where you can dock it for hands free use. I own three Nest Hubs myself and not allowing the display to detach as a tablet has always felt like a missed opportunity to me. I&rsquo;m glad to see that Google finally came around to recognizing it as well and I look forward to placing my order for both devices (tablet + base) when they become available in 2023.
