    <strong>Surface Event.</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/12/23399010/microsoft-surface-pro-9-laptop-5-studio-2-plus-event-announcements-products">Here&rsquo;s a quick recap of last week&rsquo;s Microsoft Surface Event</a>. The Surface Laptop 5, Surface Pro 9, and Surface Studio 2 were among the biggest announcements, along with <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3MsJzJe">Apple iCloud</a> and <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3S0b3aq">DALLE-2</a> integrations. The event went pretty fast, keeping things short and sweet to lead into the <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home">Ignite</a> developer event that followed. You can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/event">watch the replay</a> here.

    <strong>SDC22.</strong> Later that same day, <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/tag/sdc22/">the Samsung Developer Conference also happened</a>. The keynote focused primarily on smart home technologies, with callouts for <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-showcases-smartthings-evolution-sdc22/">SmartThings</a>, Matter compliance, and partnerships with the likes of Google, Philips Hue, and other device makers. Other highlights were integrations with Bixby voice assistant, the launch of the Samsung Gaming Hub, and <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/one-ui-5-gets-personal-sdc22-create-your-own-mobile-experiences/">One UI 5</a> updates.

    <strong>Meta Connect.</strong> Earlier in the week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/11/meta-connect-2022-roundup-quest-pro/">Meta Connect 2022 also, also happened</a>. As you might have guessed, the company formerly known as Facebook is still leaning hard into the metaverse. The biggest highlights from the event were the $1,500 VR headset Meta Quest Pro, a partnership with Microsoft on workplace tools, and&hellip;  checks notes &hellip;giving <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/11/meta-announces-legs/">avatars legs</a>? Anyways, here&rsquo;s a look at how <a href="https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2022/10/13/it-s-been-nearly-a-year-since-meta-became-meta">their year</a> is going so far. Sorry, no replay to share on this one.

    <strong>Ask Apple&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-introduces-ask-apple-for-developers/">the new interactive support series for developers launched</a>. It&rsquo;s not a week in tech news without Apple, so the company introduced a new series featuring interactive Q&amp;As and one-on-one consultations for the developer community. The first round of this ongoing series starts this week, October 17&ndash;21, and is available to current members of the Apple Developer Program and Enterprise Program.

    <strong>Roku IoT.</strong> <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90794422/roku-smart-home-wyze">Roku announced their expansion into smart home devices</a>. The company that was originally a video streaming platform is now expanding its footprint into connected devices. Through a partnership with Wyze, it hopes to not only grow marketshare but turn Roku TV into a smart home hub. The new line is available for purchase starting this week.

  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    I don&rsquo;t have anything in-depth to get into here this week, but there are a ton of device reviews coming out for the Google <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-7-review/">Pixel 7</a>, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/pixel-7-pro-review-googles-best-flagship-phone-gets-better/">Pixel 7 Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-watch/">Pixel Watch</a>. I&rsquo;m sure there will be more this/next week on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-pro-9/93VKD8NP4FVK?icid=mscom_marcom_H1a_SurfacePro9&=FY23FallSurface&=Holiday23&activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Surface Pro 9</a>. But what I&rsquo;m interested in hearing more about is the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/accessories/products/headsets/microsoft-audio-dock?activetab=overview:primaryr2">Audio Dock</a> that Microsoft kind of glazed over. In one of the scenes, I could have sworn I saw an air gesture used and I want to know more!
