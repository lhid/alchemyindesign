  <p>
    I have no idea how I missed the <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/invitation-galaxy-awesome-unpacked">Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Awesome Unpacked</a> announcement (ugh, sorry about that). Not to worry, you can <a href="https://youtu.be/17Tc8un6J40?t=1809">rewatch it here</a>. Awesome camera updates, awesome One UI 3.1, and awesome emphasis on the total product ecosystem. Awesome is for everyone!
  </p>

  <p>
    With the <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/mobile-wallet-industry-to-reach-35-trillion-by-2023-report/596621/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202021-03-16%20Retail%20Dive:%20Mobile%20Commerce%20%5Bissue:33043%5D&utm_term=Retail%20Dive:%20Mobile%20Commerce">mobile wallet industry expected to reach $3.5T by 2023</a>, there&#39;s no questioning the positive effects that mobile has had on the financial sector. Spurred on by Covid-19, it&#39;s interesting to see how much of the delayed adoption is due just as much to consumer behavior as it is infrastructure. And, based on my own in-store experiences, it has been primarily small businesses that were among the first in the US to provide mobile-payment options at the register. You&#39;re welcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Speaking of small businesses, Google, in response to Apple&#39;s Small Business Program, is also doing its part <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars">to reduce developer fees</a>. Lowering the barrier to entry for app monetization not only benefits indie devs and small shops, but also the app users and platforms as well. A win-win-win!
  </p>

  <p>
    And Apple, in keeping with updates for Google Maps, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/apple-maps-updated-with-covid-19-vaccination-locations-in-the-u-s/">updated their Maps app with vaccination location data</a>. This includes integration with Siri to more easily surface vaccine info via voice. One of those solutions that seems so obvious (now) that it&#39;s a shame it didn&#39;t roll out sooner.
  </p>

  <p>
    And this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-x-2021-hk-hands-on-071842802-175042576.html?utm_source=sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_morning_after">Oppo X 2021 prototype</a> is like a physical meme for testing responsive designs by resizing the browser window. It&#39;s also one of the first implementations of a rollable screen that I&#39;ve seen that addresses a viable use case.
