    Out of the product announcement from the Apple Event, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-ipad-pro-features-apples-m1-chip/">new iPad Pro with the M1 chip</a> is probably what I&#39;m most excited about. Between my personal MacBook Pro (13&quot;, spring 2011) that is definitely due for an upgrade and the 12.9&quot; iPad Pro (gen 1) I use for work, I am definitely leaning towards buying a new iPad Pro (+ Magic Keyboard + Pencil = cha-ching!) as a replacement. However, with the lack of native apps for common design tools (like Sketch and InDesign), it&#39;s still more of a nice-to-have than a MBP replacement.

    Remember when we were taught to <em>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</em>? Well, this new update from Samsung will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395694/samsung-galaxy-phone-upcycle-smart-home-sensor-iot">allow you to reuse older phones as smart home sensors</a>. I think that&#39;s pretty clever and I hope it catches on. Maybe from there, we can reuse them for other things like&hellip; a wifi AP or a security camera or&hellip; you get the picture. And maybe other OEMs will join in as well.

    As an avid traveler myself, I have long predicted (long = since last summer) that it will be one of the first industries to see a major boost in the post-COVID world. And brands like Expedia are preparing for that boost by <a href="https://www.marketingdive.com/news/expedia-centers-rebrand-around-mobile-as-post-covid-travel-planning-arrives/598787/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202021-04-22%20Mobile%20Weekly%20%5Bissue:33754%5D&utm_term=Marketing%20Dive:%20Mobile">positioning themselves around mobile</a>. Very few user journeys lend themselves to mobile the way that travel does and leveraging that is just smart design. I&#39;ll

    And as we wrap up last week&#39;s Spring Loaded event from Apple, we&#39;re now starting to see leaks about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-ipados-15-leak-124836745.html?utm_source=sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the_morning_after">what will be announced in this year&#39;s WWDC</a>. And if there is any truth to the rumors, then more control over my notifications is a change I welcome. More specifically, in the evening when my priorities change and I want less noise without muting everything wholesale via Do Not Disturb. Also, I&hellip; don&#39;t think I knew that widgets weren&#39;t available on iPadOS. Considering the larger screen size, seems like a missed opportunity.

    Also, <a href="https://www.shopify.ie/partners/blog/app-icon?utm_campaign=iOS%2BDev%2BWeekly&utm_medium=email&utm_source=iOS%2BDev%2BWeekly%2BIssue%2B504">your app icon is your brand</a>. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the tweet.
