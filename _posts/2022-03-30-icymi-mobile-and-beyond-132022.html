  <h2>Week 13</h2>

  <img alt="Nothing (event) live stream countdown" class="is-scalable" src="https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ef02f00f746e0f629442dbc6eec8e6a856b7c7a6/images/71d80b73-428f-0aed-3e6e-e76a948b111e.png" />

  <p>
    <strong>iPhone Subscription.</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-24/apple-is-working-on-a-hardware-subscription-service-for-iphones?sref=9hGJlFio">Apple is working on a hardware subscription service for iPhones</a>. Similar to a lease program in automotive sales, Apple wants sell hardware subscriptions like it already does services like iCloud storage and Apple Music. The buyer would be charged a monthly fee with, presumably, the option to upgrade their model when the next generation is released. And like an auto-leasing program, I would be sure to look hard at the terms of uses and conditions for upgrades before signing the dotted line.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Google Billing.</strong> <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-spotify-third-party-billing">Google launched a pilot for alternative billing options in Spotify</a>. As a result of mounting pressure and subsequent legislation, Google is exploring user choice billing in partnership with Spotify. Users will now be given the option to use either Spotify&rsquo;s payment system or Google Pay Billing when setting up their subscription in-app. This change could help developers earn more money for their apps by cutting down on commissions paid to Google. I wonder how long it will take for Apple to come around.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Nothing (event).</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-phone-1-annoumcement-143018997.html">Carl Pei gave a keynote to update the community on the upcoming phone (1)</a>. Ironically, details on the hardware itself other than a partnership with Qualcomm were, well&hellip; a whole lotta nothing. On the software end, Nothing OS focuses on being the best of Android with an iconic design language and an open ecosystem. Again, not a lot of details. Pei&rsquo;s vision of bringing the future back with exciting products is something I think the industry needs &mdash; I just hope he can deliver on that promise. You can watch <a href="https://us.nothing.tech/pages/event?mc_cid=320a991449&mc_eid=62c56c7d07">the replay here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>App Ecosystem.</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/24/app-ecosystem-growth-continued-in-q1-with-37b-downloads-new-high-of-33b-in-consumer-spending/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">Growth continued with a new high of $33B in consumer spending</a>. The lede here is that, according to the latest analysis, the global app market hasn&rsquo;t yet peaked. Gleaning data from Data.ia (formerly <em>App Annie</em>), things so far in 2022 are looking&hellip; well, pretty darn good! As a career professional, these are the types of signs I look for as indicators of industry health.

    <strong>Apps Roundup.</strong> When I started subscribing to all the newsletters that I do, it was to scour them for mobile app news. It feels like I haven&rsquo;t focused on that as much as I would like, so I&rsquo;m trying out this new section to cover app-specific news. Here it goes&hellip; <a href="https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/uber-app-list-nyc-taxis-which-could-ease-driver-shortage">Uber app</a> to list NYC taxis to ease drive shortage, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/whatsapp-message-reactions-release-3141822/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dailyauthority&utm_term=Daily%20Authority">WhatsApp</a> is finally rolling out message reactions, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/23/instagram-launches-chronological-and-favorites-feeds-for-all-users-but-they-cant-be-the-default/?utm_medium=TCnewsletter&tpcc=TCdailynewsletter">Instagram</a> launches chronological feeds for all users, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/03/24/spotify-test-drive-car-mode/">Spotify</a> is letting customers test a new Car Mode, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/03/apple-launches-the-first-drivers-license-and-state-id-in-wallet-with-arizona/">Apple</a> launches a digital driver&rsquo;s license feature. Whew!
  </p>



  <h2>From the desk of&hellip;</h2>

  <p>
    This section, when I got the nudge from my buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/chrbutler?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Chris Butler</a> to start it, was originally intended to talk about the things I&rsquo;m currently working on. A sort of behind the scenes, if you will. Since then, it has become more of an opinion section where I take a deeper dive on themes of interest (as they&rsquo;re related to mobile, of course). This week, I&rsquo;d like to take it back and let you in on what I&rsquo;ve been working on. Sound good? Cool.
  </p>

  <p>
    Last year, alongside two amazingly brilliant co-organizers, we set up an internal Mobile Community of Practice which includes a monthly recurring virtual meet-up. In next month&rsquo;s meeting, I will be giving a talk on mobile navigation for which I am currently down in the weeds building a slide deck. This also means that I&rsquo;m revisiting tons of documentation on Apple Developers, Android Developers, the iOS HIG, and, of course, Material Design. It&rsquo;s a lot of work on top of the project work I&rsquo;m already committed to doing, but it is very rewarding.
  </p>

  <p>
    While going through this exercise, I&rsquo;ve been reminded of two things. First, I&rsquo;m reminded of what a joy it is to help others along in their journey of improving their skills and knowledge. Second, I&rsquo;m also reminded of how important it is to one&rsquo;s own growth to compile your own expertise and share it with others. As many of us focus so heavily on our own deficiencies, it&rsquo;s always good &mdash; and necessary &mdash; to stop and take stock of just how much you know and understand about a particular domain. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d encourage everyone to do throughout their own journeys.
