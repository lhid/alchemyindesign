    I hope all is well. I admittedly struggled putting this issue together — mobile news was light last week and I try to avoid filler content. That said, I think you’ll enjoy the articles that I pulled together. Or, at the very least, they’ll inspire you to ponder the future ahead.

  <h2>Week 7 <small>(02/11–02/17)</small></h2>

    <strong>Google&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/02/first-developer-preview-android15.html">announced the first Developer Preview of Android 15</a>. Available now, the next major OS release will focus on user privacy and security, supporting creators, and performance. Developer previews allow teams to update their apps in advance while also providing a feedback loop before the public release.
  </p>



  <p>
    <strong>Apple&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/switch-to-iphone-2023-data-3414893/">saw fewer Android users move to iPhone in 2023</a>. According to a report from CIRP, there was a 2% drop (year-over-year) in iOS converts in the U.S. One can only speculate as to what factors contributed to the change and the report did not include iOS to Android numbers.
  </p>



  <p>
    <strong>OpenAI&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/openais-new-sora-model-can-generate-minute-long-videos-from-text-prompts-195717694.html">unveiled Sora, the new text-to-video generative AI</a>. The new model can generate complex scenes with high quality output based on user prompts. However impressive, potential abuse needs to be addressed before public availability. My buddy, Christopher Butler, believes we&rsquo;re seeing <a href="https://www.chrbutler.com/2024-02-16">AI&rsquo;s acceleration</a> in real-time (and I agree).
  </p>



  <p>
    <strong>Nothing&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/13/24070423/nothing-phone-2a-launch-event-march-5th-us-release-developer-program">announced Phone 2a will launch March 5</a>. Apart from the characteristic LED &ldquo;Glyphs&rdquo; strips, little was revealed in terms of specs, images, and pricing. However, the included interview with Nothing CEO Carl Pei and Industrial Designer Chris Weightman provides insights on the company&rsquo;s approach that I personally find refreshing.

  <p>
    <strong>TikTok&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3wiV2XZ">has launched a &ldquo;reimagined&rdquo; app for the Vision Pro</a>. The lede is in the headline, but the article itself is a UX comparison between the visionOS and iOS versions. Far from being <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-11/apple-vision-pro-review-3-499-headset-will-eventually-replace-the-ipad-lshk59z1?cmpid=BBD021124_POWERON&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=240211&utm_campaign=poweron">an iPad killer</a> just yet, I&rsquo;m most interested in seeing how teams adapt their apps to the mixed reality space.
  </p>


  <br />


  <p>
    Also, MWC 2024 is coming up next week and I&rsquo;m hoping to include pre-event articles in the next issue.
