excerpt: Talking about graphic design and my influences and mentors, I can easily rattle off several names that make my eyes light up at their mention&mdash;Herbert Bayer, Saul Bass, Paul Rand, El Lissitsky, Lazlo Moholy-Nagy, Theo van Doesburg, Jan Tschichold, I could go on, Eric Spiekermann, Massimo Vignelli, seriously. With the exceptions of Mr. Spiekermann and Mr. Vignelli, you could say that, yes, all my heroes are dead. But when we shift that conversation to web design, thankfully that is not the case.

  <h3>Back story:</h3>

  <p>
    <em>
      This article started several months ago when a colleague asked about the references I used when I made my change from print to web. I thought about it for half a day and pounded out an email lush with links to several online resources and books that helped me break into web technologies. Among them were a list of usual suspects that have a strong voice in the community. These are their names and a bit about them.

  <h2 class="hrb hrb+2"><a href="http://paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a></h2>
  <p>
    Works on Google's Chrome and JQuery. Also known for a small side project ;-) know as the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, <a href="http://html5please.com">amongst</a>  <a href="http://modernizr.com">other</a>  <a href="http://movethewebforward.org">things</a>. Extremely smart guy with loads of knowledge in front-end technologies and a witty sense of humor. I've had several laugh-outloud moments viewing his videos.

    Works for Wufoo (and by default, Survey Monkey). Host of CSS-Tricks and co-host of <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">The Shop Talk Show</a>.
    I would dare to say that this guy is the zen master of Cascading Style Sheets. I would bet you my street cred that if you had a question about CSS, Chris has covered in on his site. His radio show with Dave Rupert is fun to listen to as well as informative.

    If Chris Coyier is the zen master of CSS, then Eric Meyer is the Dalai Lama. He has years upon years of experience and fathered the <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html">CSS Reset</a>. Be sure to tell him thank you ;-)

  <h2 class="hrb hrb+2"><a href="http://www.useit.com/">Jakob Nielsen</a></h2>
  <p>
    Father Usability. He himself is a standard. His web site may not be the most aesthetically inclined, but his research and teachings on usability are sourced by thousands in the community. If someone has made a statement of usability to you, nine times out of ten they are <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/">referencing</a> an article he has written.

  This is just a starter list—a list of people that I wish someone would have given me when I first began learning front-end web technologies. There are more that could be added to this list (like <a href="http://www.lukew.com/">Luke Wroblewski</a>, <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>, <a href="http://www.stubbornella.org">Nicole Sullivan</a>, <a href="http://snook.ca/">Jonathan Snook</a>) but then the list would go on for ever... That would be overwhelming! If there is someone that you think I've missed or that you do not agree with, write me <a href="mailto:leban@alchemyindesign.com">here</a>.

  Cheers!
