  <h2>Week 32</h2>

  <img alt="Three screens of new features in iPadOS 16" class="is-scalable" src="https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/ef02f00f746e0f629442dbc6eec8e6a856b7c7a6/images/7ba1af8d-4ab8-6978-7e0e-c76519f833cf.jpg" />

    <strong>OnePlus&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/oneplus-10t-gets-a-little-faster-by-sacrificing-a-lot/">announced the new 10T at a lukewarm event</a>. If you&rsquo;re a OnePlus fan, I am truly sorry, but that was hard to sit through. As someone on the software side, the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oxygen-os-13-oneplus-3192517/">Oxygen OS 13</a> portion was what I cared most about (but missed it because meetings). And with the razor thin market share <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/us-market-smartphone-share/">in the US</a>, it&rsquo;s probably not even worth mentioning. But if you&rsquo;re just as curious about the world of Android as I am, here&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/v-DN08yMbqE">the replay</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>iPadOS 16&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-03/apple-to-delay-ipad-software-launch-by-a-month-in-unusual-move">is getting delayed until October, according to Bloomberg</a>. That&rsquo;s the difference of about at month, if you&rsquo;re wondering. One explanation is to stagger the release of iOS 16 and iPadOS 16, which makes sense for deployments and bug reporting. Another is due to the updates to iPad&rsquo;s multitasking capabilities called Stage Manager. All I know is, my wife had her iPad Pro on the public beta and it was good until it started giving us heartburn with iMessages.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Android 13&hellip;</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-13-launch-3192300/">may be ready for release as early as September</a>. According to info gleaned from security notes released by Google, there&rsquo;s specifically a callout for Android 13 devices with a security patch for 9/1. Combine that with latest release of Android 13 Beta 4.1, it&rsquo;s not too far a stretch to presume we&rsquo;re very close to a final version for public release. The question after that as which devices (outside of Pixels) will get it and when.

    <strong>Mobile Stats.</strong> <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3OQmno0">Users are spending 4-5 hours per day in mobile apps</a>. And if you factor in an average of 16 hours of waking life, that&rsquo;s over a quarter of the day spent in mobile. Wow! A new report released by data.ai, it seems the pandemic-driven boom isn&rsquo;t subsiding as consumer usage continues to grow. This suggests that, as many of us have suspected with similar pandemic-related trends, some of these new behaviors are here to stay.

    <strong>App Roundup.</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-meet-duo-combining-3171784/">Google</a> continued the next step in the Duo-Meet merger. <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3d26DRK">Microsoft</a> launched Outlook Lite for low-powered phones. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/08/01/spotify-play-shuffle-buttons/">Spotify</a> adds dedicated shuffle button to playlists. <a href="https://tcrn.ch/3cTNJwb">Pinterest</a> debuts new collaging app, Shuffles. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-app-store-today-homepage-tab-will-soon-feature-ads-084133344.html">Apple</a> will soon support feature ads in App Store.

  <h2><strong>From the desk of&hellip;</strong></h2>

  <p>
    I came across from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/5-features-samsung-android-only/">this article</a> from Wired covering some of the distinct features in Samsung&rsquo;s One UI, and I thought we might dig into it a bit. Really understanding the details and nuance of the OS is something that I feel is important to mobile designers and developers alike. Plus, writing articles about the differences between OS&rsquo;s, the experience of devices, etc is exactly what I would be doing if product design wasn&rsquo;t my full-time gig. So, this one hits the sweet spot for me.
  </p>

  <p>
    The five features discussed &mdash; hiding apps, device optimization, AOD customization, using Secure Folders, and Samsung DeX &mdash; are exclusive to Samsung. AOD (Always On Display) has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_on_Display#History">historically</a> been an Android-only feature that, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/06/07/iphone-14-pro-ios-16-always-on-display/">until recently</a>, was considered one of the key characteristics distinguishing it from iOS. Likewise, <a href="https://insights.samsung.com/2022/02/16/the-beginners-guide-to-samsung-dex-9/">Samsung DeX</a> &mdash; which I&rsquo;ve always wanted to explore &mdash; is an attempt to support cross-device workflows and extend the capabilities of mobile devices into a more desktop-like experience.

    This is just some of the stuff I geek out about in my ever-shrinking spare time. What do you geek out about?
