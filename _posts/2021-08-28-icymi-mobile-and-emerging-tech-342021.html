    <strong>Re: Smart Standards.</strong> I mentioned last week that the interoperability standard in smart home tech was set to roll out later this year. Yeah, about that&hellip; apparently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-delayed-164447784.html">it has been delayed to 2022</a>. But considering that this addresses the networking layer &mdash; essentially the heart of the connect experience &mdash; it&#39;s probably be important that they take their time and get it right.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Galaxy Watch.</strong> With all the fuss around the Z Fold and the Z Flip &mdash; and rightfully so &mdash; <a href="http://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2021/08/16/samsung-announces-galaxy-watch4-revamped-features-googlebacked-operating-system">news about the Galaxy Watch4</a> likely fell on many deaf ears. Now, I do not own any of the previous versions nor do I plan on buying the new one anytime soon, I am still an advocate for a diverse market of offerings. And, as a design nerd, I genuinely enjoy seeing how competing teams solve similar problems (e.g. screens &amp; interactions).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Android 12 Beta.</strong> The fourth release of the Android 12 beta includes an accessibility feature that <a href="http://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/">allows users to control their phone with their face!</a> Some of face gestures may sound a little odd, but I try to imagine what it is like for someone whose mobility is so limited that those types of controls may be the only options. And, having seen otherwise able-bodied people use accessibility features to enhance their overall experience, I wonder what unexpected use cases may come out of face gestures.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Mobile Wallet.</strong> If you own a Samsung Galaxy, you may be pleased to know that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-galaxy-phones-can-store-covid-vaccination-proof-in-samsung-pay/">you can now show proof of vaccination status in Samsung Pay</a>. Available on virtually all phones since 2015, you&#39;ll be able to access a digital vaccine card via the CommonHealth app. These are the sorts of helpful features that solve real world problems that I like seeing apps evolve into.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Robots!</strong> And to wrap up this issue, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-bot-humanoid-robot-033635103.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">Tesla is reportedly working on a humanoid robot</a>. Because of course they are!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Bonus:</strong> Here&#39;s a video of <a href="https://twitter.com/agiletortoise/status/1428172000955092993?s=20">the updated iPadOS keyboard shortcut menu</a>. My current focus is on tablets, so I&#39;m constantly looking for studies like these. Enjoy!
