    It's Mobile World Congress week! If you are in attendance — in Barcelona — I'm jealous. For the rest of us, we'll just have to wait for the tech news venues to pick up the announcements. In the meantime, there was a bit of movement in the app space last week, so let's dive in!

  <h2>Week 8 <small>(02/18–02/24)</small></h2>

  <p>
    <strong>MWC 2024…</strong> <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/events/mwc-barcelona-2024/">kicked off in Barcelona this week (yesterday)</a> and here are some things <a href="https://mashable.com/article/mwc-2024-what-to-expect">we can expect</a>. I’ll do the full rundown in the next issue, but from what I’ve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mwc-2024/">already seen</a> in my Instagram feed, it's already getting exciting!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Apple…</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/02/introducing-apple-sports-a-new-app-for-sports-fans/">released a new Apple Sports app for iPhone</a>. Available in the US, Canada, and the UK, it keeps fans up to date with real-time scores and stats across several leagues. With Apple’s latest investments in sports, it’s not surprising that they would design an accompanying app. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Apple Music…</strong> <a href="updated the Replay experience with a monthly version">updated the Replay experience with a monthly version</a>. Similar to the annual version, it’s a recap of your listening habits via top artists, songs, and includes visualizations for milestones. I’ll be interested to see if users find this feature useful in the long-term.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Google Pay…</strong> <a href="app will be sunset in the US on June 4, 2024">app will be sunset in the US on June 4, 2024</a>. Google Wallet, which already existed in parallel, will take over as the primary solution for mobile payments. Google Pay is dead, long live Google Wallet!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Android 15…</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-features-3401939/">and a list of features and changes via Developer Preview 1</a>. Complete with screenshots, the write-up combs through the various updates we might expect to see. With the announcement of the Dev Preview, I fully expected to find exactly this type of helpful article — and it does not disappoint.
