# Production Notes

## Tools Used

* HTML 5 Boilerplate
* Normalize.css
* Sass
* jQuery lightSlider
* jQuery lightGallery
* HTML/CSS all hand-rolled :-)

## Approach

* SMACSS file structure
* OOCSS design principles
* BEM naming conventions
* Basic a11y considerations, but needs more work (e.g. nav, form)

## Other Notes

* No character escaping due to wide UTF-8 support
* No SVGs due to lack of IE8 support
* Set majority measurements in ems for better scalability
* Mobile First CSS at start, but IE8 support took priority
* Some responsive considerations in place
